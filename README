CREST
=====

cREST is a simple cli to tests REST endpoints, it depends on libcurl
and is released under the OpenBSD license (ISC basically.)


Building
--------

Make sure you have libcurl installed (you may need a libcurl
dev/devel/develop package) and execute `make'.  You should find the
`crest' executable.

AFAIK it should build on every (reasonably recent) POSIX-conforming OS
where libcurl and asprintf(3) are available.


Usage
-----

By executing `./crest' you should get a prompt `> '.  The syntax for the
REPL is quite simple: every command is either a help request, a pipe
or a request.

The syntax for the request is: ``VERB URL PAYLOAD'' where the verb is
an HTTP method (the case doesn't matter) like GET or POST (or HEAD, PUT,
...), the url is (unsurprisingly) the url and the payload is optional.

The pipes are special commands used to ``pipe'' the last received response
to a command.  The syntax is `|cmd', where `cmd' is a sh(1) command.
The given command will be exec'd as ``/bin/sh -c cmd'' and its stdin
will be the last received HTTP response.

An help request is either `help' or `usage' and all they do is print a
brief usage.


Flags
-----

To avoid typing the whole URL every time, cREST supports the `-h'
flag to set a prefix.  During the session it is used, every URL will
be prefixed with that prefix.  For example, let's say that we execute
`./crest -h example.com', then we run at the repl `get user/5'.  The URL
of the request will be the prefix + / + the url given in the command,
that is `example.com/user/5'.

The `-v' flag increase the verbosity.  Can be provided more than once.

The `-i' flag disables the verification of the TLS cert used by the
server.


TIPS
----

If you're working with some json api, make sure to try jid[1].  It's
glorious to do `get some/endp' and inspecting the response with
`|jid'.  The whole idea of the pipe was implemented just to do this.

To save the last body use `|cat > path/to/file.json'.

Works really well inside acme(1).

TODOs
-----

 - [ ] implement the code for CONNECT, DELETE, OPTIONS, PATCH
       PUT & TRACE.
 - [ ] flag to define headers
 - [ ] flag to choose the default HTTP version
 - [ ] flag (or something else) to hide/blacklist some/all response
       header
 - [ ] `set' command to change some parameters at runtime
 - [ ] `add'/`del' command (or better terms?) to add/delete custom
       HTTP headers
 - [ ] cookie support? not so sure about this.
